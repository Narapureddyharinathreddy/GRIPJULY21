            The Akshaya Patra Foundation is an NGO in India headquartered in Bengaluru. Our organisation strives to eliminate classroom hunger by
            implementing the Mid-Day Meal Scheme in the government schools and government-aided schools. Alongside,
            Akshaya Patra also aims at countering malnutrition and supporting the right to education of socio-economically disadvantaged children.
            Since 2000, Akshaya Patra has been concerting all its efforts towards providing fresh and nutritious meals to children on every single school day.
            We are continuously leveraging technology to multiply our reach. The state-of-the-art kitchens have become a subject of study and have
            attracted curious visitors from around the world.Our partnership with the Government of India and various State Governments, along with the persistent support from corporates, individual donors, and well-wishers have helped us to grow from serving just 1,500 children in 5 schools in 2000 to serving 1.8 million children.
            Today, Akshaya Patra is the world’s largest (not-for-profit run) Mid-Day Meal Programme serving wholesome food every school day to
            over 1.8 million children from 19,039 schools across 12 states & 2 Union territories of India.

          <p>"Charity means helping the hapless, the needy and the infirm in whatever way I can. That way,
          I can make them feel that they are not alone in this world. 
          I am particularly impressed with the efficiency of the kitchens and the sincerity of the people manning the units at Akshaya Patra."</p>

          <p>“I was totally satisfied, both with the method of disbursement and the target population.
                Instead of spending money on yearly rituals on my parents’ death anniversary, 
                I donate the amount to Akshaya Patra. Money spent on God’s children should please the God anyway.”</p>

          <h3>Deepak M  Investment Banker,</h3>
          <p>“About 10 years ago, when I was assisting a large municipality on the mid-day meal scheme, I evaluated Akshaya Patra and its delivery capabilities. 
                I was impressed with its intentions, team and operations, and started donating. From supporting a few students initially,
                  to supporting many more now, I intend to keep increasing my contribution with every successive year.”</p>
